# Virtual Studio

Aug - 2023

This is an old class project I made to get introduced to working with unity engine.

In this demo I programmed an audio synthesizer directly in code, but I've since 
learned that the unreal engine has something called "MetaSounds" which is a more 
polished version of what I had been working on, so I will make an updated version 
of this project in unreal engine in my free time.

For now have fun with this tiny playground I've put together. All the controls are 
seen once you launch the application but just a heads up it uses arrow key movement 
and mouse aiming.

This repo contains the source files I produced, but if you would like to see the final result you can view it at this youtube video or download the project through the following links:
